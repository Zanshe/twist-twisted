# Twist Twisted

This makes several improvements on twist.com. You can try it out quickly by going there and copy/pasting this in the console:

```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script'); 
script.setAttribute('src', "https://mikabytes.github.io/twist-twisted/index.js"); 
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

You'll need to do it everytime you restart the page though. 

The better way is to install Tampermonkey or something similar and create a script doing the same.
